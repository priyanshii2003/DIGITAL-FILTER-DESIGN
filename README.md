##DESCRIPTION* : Task 4 involves the design and simulation of a **digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter** using Verilog HDL to demonstrate basic digital signal processing concepts. A simple 3-tap FIR filter is implemented using fixed coefficients and delay elements, where the output is calculated as a weighted sum of the current input sample and a finite number of previous input samples. The design operates synchronously with a clock signal and includes a reset mechanism to initialize internal registers. Delay registers are used to store past input values, and a multiply-accumulate structure is employed to generate the filtered output. A Verilog testbench is developed to apply a sequence of input samples and generate the clock and reset signals. The design is simulated using EDA Playground with the Icarus Verilog simulator, and waveform analysis is performed using EPWave to observe the relationship between input samples, delayed values, and the filtered output. The simulation results confirm correct FIR filtering behavior, and all Verilog source files, testbench code, and waveform evidence are organized and uploaded to a GitHub repository as part of the task submission.
